suggestions for improvement:
- Consider adding comments to explain more complex logic, although the code is mostly self-explanatory.
- The frequent use of f-strings enhances readability.
Brief justification:
- correctness: All exercises are completed correctly. Each function fulfills its specific requirements as outlined in the chapter content. The outputs match the expected outputs, and all functionalities are implemented as described.
- readability: The code is well-structured and easy to follow. Function names are descriptive, and the use of f-strings makes the code readable. Some additional comments could further enhance readability, especially for more complex parts.
- performance: The code demonstrates efficient use of built-in functions and data structures, resulting in good performance for the given tasks.
- security: The code doesn't involve any external inputs or sensitive operations, making it inherently secure.
