suggestions for improvement:
- The check_win function could be improved. The original attempt, commented out, was closer to correct. The issue is that it needs to check if the board positions specified in win_condition are equal to the player's symbol and not just return after checking the first win condition. It also uses all() incorrectly, causing premature termination.
- The check_tie function is correct but could be more concise and readable by removing the commented out code.
- The valid_moves list is being mutated alongside the board, this creates an error with the check_win function and an inability to add new moves. This should be refactored.
- The display_board function looks good but can be slightly improved for formatting.
- Error checking for the input is basic. The input should be validated to ensure it's in the correct format (A1-C3) and to be sure the location to be changed isn't already occupied.
Brief justification:
- correctness: The code addresses the core requirements of the Tic Tac Toe game. It initializes the board, displays it, takes player input, checks for a winner and a tie, and switches players. However, the check_win function is flawed due to incorrect use of all(), and valid_moves is being mutated alongside the board, leading to incorrect game logic. The game functions as described, but doesn't fully and accurately meet all the requirements due to these errors.
- readability: The code is reasonably readable. Function names are descriptive, and the code is structured logically. However, some of the commented-out code in check_tie could be removed for better clarity. Some of the string formatting in display_board could be more concise.
- performance: The performance is adequate for a simple Tic Tac Toe game. There are no computationally expensive operations. However, repeatedly calling valid_moves.index(move) could be slightly optimized if necessary.
- security: There are no apparent security vulnerabilities in this code. It does not handle any external input or sensitive data.
